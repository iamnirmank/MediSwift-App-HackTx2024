# MediSwift

MediSwift is an AI-powered health assistant designed to streamline the end-to-end treatment process for patients and doctors. By automating tasks, MediSwift reduces wait times and costs, offering accessible, timely, and affordable healthcare.

## Inspiration
After a personal experience with delayed treatment and high costs, we realized the need for a more efficient, affordable healthcare solution. MediSwift aims to bridge this gap by digitalizing and automating treatment processes with AI, enabling timely and cost-effective care, especially for those abroad or with limited healthcare access.

## Features
- **Symptom Collection**: Patients describe symptoms via chatbot; AI guides follow-up questions to gather detailed info.
- **AI-Powered Diagnosis**: AI generates a preliminary diagnosis, which is reviewed by a doctor for further actions.
- **Treatment and Follow-Up**: Doctors can approve diagnoses, provide prescriptions, and suggest follow-ups. Automated reminders keep patients on track with their treatment.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Built with Next.js
- **Backend**: Developed on Django
- **AI**: LLM fine-tuning and prompt engineering for health data

## Challenges
Limited resources (device capability, internet access) made fine-tuning the AI challenging. We optimized our approach with PERT and LoRA but ultimately relied on prompt engineering for the MVP.

## Accomplishments
Despite these challenges, we developed a working MVP in 24 hours, integrating core features across frontend, backend, and AI, with a functional prototype for both patients and doctors.

## Next Steps
Our goal is to refine the MVP and fine-tune the AI with extensive health data to support more conditions. We plan to release a full prototype for user testing within three months.
